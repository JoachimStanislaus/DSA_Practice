# Data Structures and Algorithms - Arrays & Strings in Python

# 1. ARRAYS
# Arrays are contiguous memory locations to store elements of the same data type. In Python, lists can serve as arrays.

# Basic Array Operations
# - Accessing elements
# - Adding elements (append, insert)
# - Removing elements (pop, remove)
# - Iterating through an array

# 2. ARRAY ALGORITHMS
# - Reverse an Array
# - Find the Maximum and Minimum in an Array
# - Check for Duplicates
# - Rotate Array to the Right by K steps

# 3. STRINGS
# Strings are sequences of characters and are immutable in Python.

# Basic String Operations
# - Accessing characters
# - String Length
# - Substrings
# - Concatenation
# - Reverse a String
# - Split and Join
# - Check Palindrome

# 4. STRING ALGORITHMS
# - Count Occurrences of a Character
# - Check Anagram
# - Find First Non-Repeating Character

# 5. PRACTICE QUESTIONS
# 1. Reverse a String without using slicing
# 2. Find the Second Largest Element in an Array
# 3. Check if a String Contains Only Digits
# 4. Implement a Function to Rotate an Array Left by K Steps
# 5. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
