# Implement a basic binary tree

# Tree Traversals (Implement the following traversal methods)
# Traversal means visiting all the nodes in some order. Common traversal methods are:

# 1. Inorder (Left, Root, Right)
# 2. Preorder (Root, Left, Right)
# 3. Postorder (Left, Right, Root)
# 4. Level-order (Breadth-first)

# Practice Problems
# 1. Implement a function to calculate the height of a tree.
# 2. Check if a binary tree is balanced.
# 3. Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.
# 4. Implement a binary search tree (BST) and include search functionality.
# 5. Count the number of leaf nodes in a tree.
