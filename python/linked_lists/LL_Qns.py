# 5. LINKED LISTS
# A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains:
# 1. Data (the value to store)
# 2. A reference (or pointer) to the next node

# Types of Linked Lists:
# - Singly Linked List
# - Doubly Linked List
# - Circular Linked List

# 5.1 Singly Linked List
# - Insert at the beginning
# - Insert at the end
# - Delete by value
# - Print the linked list

# 5.2 Doubly Linked List
# - Insert at the end
# - Print the linked list

# 6. PRACTICE QUESTIONS
# 1. Implement a Singly Linked List with insert, delete, and print methods.
# 2. Reverse a Singly Linked List.
# 3. Find the Middle Element of a Linked List.
# 4. Detect a Cycle in a Linked List.
# 5. Implement a Doubly Linked List with insert and print methods.
